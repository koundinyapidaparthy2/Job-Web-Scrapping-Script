Realistic Review without Hype","They say that this phone is value for money and powerful but on one hand it is expensive and cannot be afforded by everyone. Honestly in my opinion I would say that this phone is a little too expensive for the features it is providing. The camera is good and better than all the other phones but it is sometimes not that good as taking photos in a DSLR camera. (Not always)In artificial lighting conditions such as office interiors the photos tends to be a little grainy upon zooming beyond 10x. Also this phone boasts about a 200 megapixel camera but upon zooming in to the pictures I don't really see a huge difference of the photos compared to other phones.The display quality, speaker sound, gaming performance etc is excellent but the phone shows heating issue while using the camera or playing games (it's not a big problem). I would rate the pricing of this phone to be correct at around ‚Çπ80,000Initially when I held the phone it was too big for my hands but now I have grown use to it after just one week use. But honestly speaking I don't really feel like I am holding a phone worth rupees 1 lakh. The in-hand feel is not that premium. This could be because Samsung phones have been always using similar designs and my previous phone was also a Samsung that pretty much looked the same.I have ordered Spigen Case for my phone, but cannot use tempered screen guard coz the PHONE CASE is too thick. You can only use regular screen guard with the case.The fact is that this phone is the best phone in the market right now & I can confidently use it without any regrets or confusions of buying other phones. Looking forward to use it for the next 3-4 years.Overall, the S23 Ultra still has no competitor! üòé"

Don't buy from amazon","5g is not working on my phone in India, when checked with samsung support, they said this is an oversea product, hence 5g will not work in India for you.Even when checked in samsung official website the model no on box doesn't match with number provided by samsung on website with imei, or the number present on phone.I have been talking with amazon customer care team since the day phone got delivered, and amazon is not providing me with replacement or refund."

Battery Life",Except Battery Life the phone is amazing.  I have read the reviews all across and saw many you tube vidoes and everyone suggested that it gives improved battery back up but screen on time usage is around 5 to 6 hours only.

The best phone out there!",True flagship phone. Insane photo and video quality. Also the build and performance. Not a single lag and previous phone was M31. A great upgrade with no regret for a content creator.

Not really worth it","I personally feel spending around 100k bucks on a phone is dumb. When you can get most of the features that this phone has in 25k to 30k phone, then I don't see any reason why people are going so mad about it.when you cannot use the full potential of the processing power of even a 20k phone then why waste money for such costly phones.I would suggest you should invest this money to somewhere more productive where you can get good returns."

You can only use regular screen guard with the case.The fact is that this phone is the best phone in the market right now & I can confidently use it without any regrets or confusions of buying other phones. Looking forward to use it for the next 3-4 years.Overall, the S23 Ultra still has no competitor! üòé"

Not really worth it","I personally feel spending around 100k bucks on a phone is dumb. When you can get most of the features that this phone has in 25k to 30k phone, then I don't see any reason why people are going so mad about it.when you cannot use the full potential of the processing power of even a 20k phone then why waste money for such costly phones.I would suggest you should invest this money to somewhere more productive where you can get good returns."

Realistic Review without Hype","They say that this phone is value for money and powerful but on one hand it is expensive and cannot be afforded by everyone. Honestly in my opinion I would say that this phone is a little too expensive for the features it is providing. The camera is good and better than all the other phones but it is sometimes not that good as taking photos in a DSLR camera. (Not always)In artificial lighting conditions such as office interiors the photos tends to be a little grainy upon zooming beyond 10x. Also this phone boasts about a 200 megapixel camera but upon zooming in to the pictures I don't really see a huge difference of the photos compared to other phones.The display quality, speaker sound, gaming performance etc is excellent but the phone shows heating issue while using the camera or playing games (it's not a big problem). I would rate the pricing of this phone to be correct at around ‚Çπ80,000Initially when I held the phone it was too big for my hands but now I have grown use to it after just one week use.

Don't buy from amazon","5g is not working on my phone in India, when checked with samsung support, they said this is an oversea product, hence 5g will not work in India for you.Even when checked in samsung official website the model no on box doesn't match with number provided by samsung on website with imei, or the number present on phone.I have been talking with amazon customer care team since the day phone got delivered, and amazon is not providing me with replacement or refund."

Battery Life",Except Battery Life the phone is amazing.  I have read the reviews all across and saw many you tube vidoes and everyone suggested that it gives improved battery back up but screen on time usage is around 5 to 6 hours only.

Not really worth it","I personally feel spending around 100k bucks on a phone is dumb. When you can get most of the features that this phone has in 25k to 30k phone, then I don't see any reason why people are going so mad about it.when you cannot use the full potential of the processing power of even a 20k phone then why waste money for such costly phones.I would suggest you should invest this money to somewhere more productive where you can get good returns."

Realistic Review without Hype","They say that this phone is value for money and powerful but on one hand it is expensive and cannot be afforded by everyone. Honestly in my opinion I would say that this phone is a little too expensive for the features it is providing. The camera is good and better than all the other phones but it is sometimes not that good as taking photos in a DSLR camera. (Not always)In artificial lighting conditions such as office interiors the photos tends to be a little grainy upon zooming beyond 10x. Also this phone boasts about a 200 megapixel camera but upon zooming in to the pictures I don't really see a huge difference of the photos compared to other phones.The display quality, speaker sound, gaming performance etc is excellent but the phone shows heating issue while using the camera or playing games (it's not a big problem). I would rate the pricing of this phone to be correct at around ‚Çπ80,000Initially when I held the phone it was too big for my hands but now I have grown use to it after just one week use. But honestly speaking I don't really feel like I am holding a phone worth rupees 1 lakh. The in-hand feel is not that premium. This could be because Samsung phones have been always using similar designs and my previous phone was also a Samsung that pretty much looked the same.I have ordered Spigen Case for my phone, but cannot use tempered screen guard coz the PHONE CASE is too thick. You can only use regular screen guard with the case.The fact is that this phone is the best phone in the market right now & I can confidently use it without any regrets or confusions of buying other phones. Looking forward to use it for the next 3-4 years.Overall, the S23 Ultra still has no competitor! üòé"

When you can get most of the features that this phone has in 25k to 30k phone, then I don't see any reason why people are going so mad about it.when you cannot use the full potential of the processing power of even a 20k phone then why waste money for such costly phones.I would suggest you should invest this money to somewhere more productive where you can get good returns."

Realistic Review without Hype","They say that this phone is value for money and powerful but on one hand it is expensive and cannot be afforded by everyone. Honestly in my opinion I would say that this phone is a little too expensive for the features it is providing. The camera is good and better than all the other phones but it is sometimes not that good as taking photos in a DSLR camera. (Not always)In artificial lighting conditions such as office interiors the photos tends to be a little grainy upon zooming beyond 10x. Also this phone boasts about a 200 megapixel camera but upon zooming in to the pictures I don't really see a huge difference of the photos compared to other phones.The display quality, speaker sound, gaming performance etc is excellent but the phone shows heating issue while using the camera or playing games (it's not a big problem). I would rate the pricing of this phone to be correct at around ‚Çπ80,000Initially when I held the phone it was too big for my hands but now I have grown use to it after just one week use. But honestly speaking I don't really feel like I am holding a phone worth rupees 1 lakh. The in-hand feel is not that premium. This could be because Samsung phones have been always using similar designs and my previous phone was also a Samsung that pretty much looked the same.I have ordered Spigen Case for my phone, but cannot use tempered screen guard coz the PHONE CASE is too thick. You can only use regular screen guard with the case.The fact is that this phone is the best phone in the market right now & I can confidently use it without any regrets or confusions of buying other phones. Looking forward to use it for the next 3-4 years.Overall, the S23 Ultra still has no competitor! üòé"

The best phone out there!",True flagship phone. Insane photo and video quality. Also the build and performance. Not a single lag and previous phone was M31. A great upgrade with no regret for a content creator.
